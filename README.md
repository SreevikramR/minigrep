# Minigrep
This is a basic implementation of grep to learn rust. This is not at a usable state, it was built only to learn the basics of rust. Link for tutorial: [Rust Docs](https://doc.rust-lang.org/book/ch12-00-an-io-project.html)

Command it run it:
`cargo run <search-query> <file>`

An extra environment variable `IGNORE_CASE` can also be added to trigger search with insensitive case settings.
